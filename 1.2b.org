* Categories vs Tags in a PKM system :ZK:PKM:STRUCTURE:
#+HTML:</details>
The difference between a =category= and =tag= are boiled down one being /hierarchical/ and the other /a-hierarchical/
  + =category= seems to be more /organized/ than =tag= which all over the place. =category= fails when it comes to big archive due to simple fact that /there are no category that fits anything/
  + =tag= seems a little overwhelming due to the sheer number of it. Each =object= has their own =tags= and can be mistakenly takes for =category=
    * =tags= are more precise compares to =category= which feels like a broad umbrella [fn:1]
    * =tags= can be thought as =category= if *not* careful
  + And just like [[id:89862521-3ca8-4d9c-b616-9f7a11ec5088][Choosing PKM Structure <1.2a>]], choosing a /tag system/ is as important as choosing the structure for a =PKM=

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE:
  Personal knowledge management (PKM) is a process of collecting information that a person uses to gather, classify, store, search, retrieve and share knowledge in their daily activity and the way in which these processes support work activities
  #+END_QUOTE:

- A Personal knowledge management is about taking control of the endless stream of information we encounter daily
 - Information in a PKM should be written with care and well processed
 - PKM helps streamlining the process of collecting information over the internet and put then back in a meaningful configuration
 - PKM information should *not* be scrapped directly from source but rather written in a well thought and carefully formatted
- There are many different =formats= or =configurations= out there such as:
  - *Zettelkasten -* A slip-box method developed by a German (Niklas LuhMann)
  - *PARA -* A simple, comprehensive, yet extremely flexible system
